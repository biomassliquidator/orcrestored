# Old Right Click Restored

Old Right Click Restored is just a simple script to bring back the
old Windows 10 style Right-Click Context Menu. 

To use it simply run the "orcrestored" batch file. The script 
will give you the option to either enable the Old Right-Click Menu or
Disable it to bring back the new Windows 11 one. 

After selecting an option it applies it and restarts Windows 
Explorer for the selection to take effect. In some rare cases
you may need to restart your PC for it to kick in.
